# Energy-Drink-ROI-Analysis
## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing the weekly sales and advertising data of Number 2 Energy Drink over a period of 104 weeks. The primary goal is to measure the effectiveness of various advertising channels, calculate the Return on Investment (RoI) for these channels, and develop a dashboard that not only displays the impact of different allocation options but also recommends optimal allocation strategies.

## Data Description
The dataset includes weekly sales and advertising data across various channels for 104 weeks. This comprehensive data set enables an in-depth analysis of channel performance and its impact on sales.

## Objectives
**Measure Channel Effectiveness**: Analyze the data to understand the effectiveness of each advertising channel.
**Calculate RoI**: Compute the Return on Investment for the advertising efforts in each channel.
**Develop an Interactive Dashboard**: Create a dashboard that visualizes the impact of different advertising allocations and suggests optimal strategies.
**Allocation Recommendations**: Provide recommendations on how to optimally allocate advertising budgets across channels.

## Methodology
**OLS Regression Model**: Utilize Ordinary Least Squares regression to estimate the relationship between advertising spend and sales.
**Log/Log Specification**: Explore a log-log model to understand the elasticity of sales with respect to advertising spend.
**Interaction Effects Analysis**: Investigate potential interaction effects across different advertising channels to identify synergies or conflicts.
